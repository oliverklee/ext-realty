Create the records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. |img-15|  *Figure 15: create the auxiliary records which you will
   need*

   In the “data pool” system folder, create the auxiliary records which you will need for the first set of realty objects. To be able to create a realty object record, you'll need to have least one city record in this folder. The other record types are optional to use.

#. After you have created the necessary auxiliary records, you can create
   realty objects in the corresponding system folders. In the realty
   object records, you can select from the auxiliary records which you've
   just created.

**Important note: If you create the auxiliary records first, they’ll
be listed automatically when you edit realty object records.**
